Thank you for your attention and reading!
The code is written to simulate the magma ocean evolution on lava planets.
In the model, ocean circulation is included, which is not coupled to the atmosphere but forced by surface forcing.
The model is an idealized 2D model, x-z directions are resolved, y direvtion is not resolved.

The partial equations are resolved by finite difference method using Matlab.

The main code to run the simulation is main_equalDZ.m and main_delR.m.

In main_equalDZ.m, H is 2 km by default, vertical resolution is 20 m equally, and nz = 101.
This setup has higher vertical resolution even in the bottom layer, which runs slowly.

In main_delR.m, H is 5 km by default, vertical resolution varies from 40 at the surface and 400 m at the bottom layer, nz is 49.
This setup makes the model run faster with a deeper depth and coarse resolution in the deep layer.

a new version named version2 20241017.zip is uploaded
Compared to the original version, there is nearly no difference in the codes, 
except that the codes are relatively well organized and more friendly to readers.

In version2, the main code is main_magmaocean2D.m
