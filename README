Thank you for your attention and reading!

The difference between H2km and H5km is in the vertical range of the simulate domain
and the vertical resolution.

For H2km_dz_equal, H is 2 km by default, vertical resolution is 20 m equally, and nz = 101.
This setup has higher vertical resolution even in the bottom layer, which runs slowly.

For H5km_delR_unequal, H is 5 km by default, vertical resolution varies from 40~400 m, nz is smaller (details see main_delR.m).
This setup makes the model run faster with a deeper depth and coarse resolution in the deep layer.
